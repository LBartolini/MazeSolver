# MazeSolver

This is a project where I try to implement RQL in a simple
scenario where the user is able to edit the maze as he likes and 
then see the actual learning phase of the RQL Agent (actually I don't
know if I'm going to do this).
<br>I have to decide to use PyGame or Turtle for the GUI.

Enjoy!
